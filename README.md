## üöÄ Deploying to PythonAnywhere (Free Tier)
1. **Create a PythonAnywhere Account**  
   Sign up for a free account at [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).

2. **Upload Your Project**  
   - Use the PythonAnywhere file manager or SSH to upload the `Mindful Blog-backend/` folder.  
   - Alternatively, clone the repo directly on PythonAnywhere:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/Mindful Blog-backend.git
     ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
   Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.10 Mindful Blog-venv
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the WSGI File**  
   - Update the WSGI configuration file (under the "Web" tab in PythonAnywhere) to point to your Django project's `wsgi.py`.  
   - Example `wsgi.py` path: `/home/yourusername/Mindful Blog-backend/Mindful_Blog/wsgi.py`.

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**  
   In the PythonAnywhere "Web" tab, add environment variables from `.env.example`:  
   - `SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key-here`  
   - `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////home/yourusername/Mindful_Blog/db.sqlite3` (or PostgreSQL URL)  
   - `CLOUDINARY_URL`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, etc., as needed.

6. **Run Migrations**  
   In the PythonAnywhere Bash console:  
   ```bash
   cd /home/yourusername/Mindful_Blog
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Serve Static Files**  
   - Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to collect static files.  
   - Configure the static files mapping in the PythonAnywhere "Web" tab (e.g., `/static/` ‚Üí `/home/yourusername/Mindful Blog-backend/static/`).

8. **Reload the Web App**  
   Click the "Reload" button in the PythonAnywhere "Web" tab to apply changes.

### Notes for PythonAnywhere Free Tier
- Free tier has limited CPU and memory; use SQLite for simplicity or a lightweight PostgreSQL setup.  
- HTTPS is provided automatically for `*.pythonanywhere.com` domains.  
- Static file serving is supported, but ensure `collectstatic` is run after updates.  
- No WebSocket support on the free tier; avoid real-time features like live commenting.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

### Supported Versions
The Mindful Blog Backend project actively maintains security updates for the following versions:

| Version  | Supported          |
|----------|--------------------|
| main     | ‚úÖ                 |
| v1.x.x   | ‚úÖ                 |

### Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in Mindful Blog Backend, we encourage responsible disclosure. Please follow these steps:  
- Do not report security issues publicly via GitHub issues or other public forums.  
- Send a detailed report to your.email@example.com. Include:  
  - A description of the vulnerability.  
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.  
  - Potential impact (e.g., data exposure, unauthorized access).  
  - Any suggested fixes (optional).  

Allow the project maintainers up to 14 days to respond and assess the issue.  
We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and work with you to validate and address the vulnerability.

### Disclosure Process
Once a vulnerability is reported, maintainers will:  
- Validate the issue and assess its severity.  
- Develop and test a fix.  
- Release the fix in a new version or patch.  
- Credit the reporter (unless anonymity is requested) in release notes.  

We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days and less severe issues within 60 days.

### Security Best Practices
To ensure the security of your Mindful Blog Backend deployment:  
- Never commit sensitive information (e.g., `.env` files, `SECRET_KEY`) to version control.  
- Use a strong, unique `SECRET_KEY` for Django (at least 50 characters, generated securely).  
- Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
  ```  
- Enable HTTPS for production deployments (automatic on PythonAnywhere).  
- Monitor logs and enable security headers (e.g., CSP, X-Frame-Options) in your Django settings or PythonAnywhere web server configuration.

### Known Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is secure and unique for session-based authentication. Use Django‚Äôs `check_password` for secure password handling.  
- **Database**: Restrict access to the database server and use environment-specific configurations.  
- **Image Uploads**: Validate and sanitize all user-uploaded content (e.g., via Cloudinary).  
- **API Security**: Use Django REST Framework‚Äôs throttling and input validation to prevent abuse.  
- **Session Security**: Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True` in production.
